        <h3> <b> List of Questions to ask SleekFlow during Zoom Meeting</b></h3>
<section>
    <p> 
        <br><b> Q1: Is it Possible to Add Branching in Automation?</b>
        <br>Example: If Input = A, Output = XElse if Input = B, Output = Y
        <br>Reason: This would help to limit the No. of Automations & Make Automation Flow Neater and Compact
    </p>

</section>

<section>
    <p> 
        <br><b> Q2: Is Possible to allow Multiple Inputs in 1 Message?</b>
        <br>Example: Just Type in "1, 2, 3, 4" and all the  4 Automations will play out
        <br>Reason: Customers can activate all the Necessary Inputs in 1 Go, reduce Time Taken and Motion Waste
    </p>

</section>

<section>
    <p> 
        <br><b> Q3: Is it Possible to Allow Customers to Input Variables</b>
        <br>Example: Customer wants to schedule a meeting. <br>They only have to type in the ChatBot "[[appointment date]] = (25/6/2022 9:30AM)". <br>After that Automation will schedule meeting during that time
        <br>Reason: (1) Reduce User Friction, (2)Improves UX Experience, (3)Allowing Customer to use Variables expands Potential of SleekFlow Automations Waste
    </p>
